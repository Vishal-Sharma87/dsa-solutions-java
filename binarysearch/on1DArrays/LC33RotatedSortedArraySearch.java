     * 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
     * There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct
     * values).
     * 
     * Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly left rotated at an
     * unknown index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is
     * [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]
     * (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be left rotated by 3 indices
     * and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].
     * 
     * Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target,
     * return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.
     * 
     * You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * Example 1:
     * 
     * Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
     * Output: 4
     * Example 2:
     * 
     * Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
     * Output: -1
     * Example 3:
     * 
     * Input: nums = [1], target = 0
     * Output: -1
     * 
     * 
     * Constraints:
     * 
     * 1 <= nums.length <= 5000
     * -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
     * All values of nums are unique.
     * nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
     * -104 <= target <= 104

         * APPROACH
         * 
         * When a sorted array is rotated then both halves adjacent to "mid" are not
         * always sorted, but either of them is always sorted
         * 
         * 1.find the sorted one
         * 2.check whether the target lies is sorted part or not
         * 3.eliminate the other half accordingly
         * 
         * 
         * TIME : O(logN)
         * SPACE : constant
