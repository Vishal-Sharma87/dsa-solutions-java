         * 2149. Rearrange Array Elements by Sign
         * You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of even length consisting of an
         * equal number of positive and negative integers.
         * 
         * You should return the array of nums such that the array follows the given
         * conditions:
         * 
         * Every consecutive pair of integers have opposite signs.
         * For all integers with the same sign, the order in which they were present in
         * nums is preserved.
         * The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.
         * Return the modified array after rearranging the elements to satisfy the
         * aforementioned conditions.
         * 
         * 
         * 
         * Example 1:
         * 
         * Input: nums = [3,1,-2,-5,2,-4]
         * Output: [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4]
         * Explanation:
         * The positive integers in nums are [3,1,2]. The negative integers are
         * [-2,-5,-4].
         * The only possible way to rearrange them such that they satisfy all conditions
         * is [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4].
         * Other ways such as [1,-2,2,-5,3,-4], [3,1,2,-2,-5,-4], [-2,3,-5,1,-4,2] are
         * incorrect because they do not satisfy one or more conditions.
         * Example 2:
         * 
         * Input: nums = [-1,1]
         * Output: [1,-1]
         * Explanation:
         * 1 is the only positive integer and -1 the only negative integer in nums.
         * So nums is rearranged to [1,-1].
         * 
         * 
         * Constraints:
         * 
         * 2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 105
         * nums.length is even
         * 1 <= |nums[i]| <= 105
         * nums consists of equal number of positive and negative integers.
         * 
         * 
         * It is not required to do the modifications in-place.
