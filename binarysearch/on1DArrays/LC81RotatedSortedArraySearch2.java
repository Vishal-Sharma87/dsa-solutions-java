         * 
         * When a sorted array conatines duplicate and is rotated then
         * 
         * there can be two scenarios
         * 1111112111
         * low mid and high have same value-> just shrink the halves by one index
         * else both halves adjacent to "mid" are not always sorted, but either of them
         * is
         * always sorted
         * 
         * 1.find the sorted one
         * 2.check whether the target lies is sorted part or not
         * 3.eliminate the other half accordingly
         * 
         * 
         * TIME : O(logN)
         * SPACE : constant
