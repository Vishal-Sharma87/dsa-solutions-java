/*
Problem Description:
--------------------
Statement:
Given an array containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the
only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Example:
Input:
nums = [3, 0, 1]

Output:
2

Constraints:
- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 10^4
- 0 <= nums[i] <= n
- All numbers are unique.
*/

/*
Approach 1: Sorting

Idea:
Sort the array and compare each index with its corresponding value.
The first mismatch indicates the missing number.

Time Complexity:
O(n log n)

Space Complexity:
O(1) or O(log n) depending on the sorting algorithm.

Drawbacks:
Sorting modifies the array and is slower than necessary.
*/

/*
Approach 2: Hashing

Idea:
Store all numbers in a boolean array or HashSet and scan from 0 to n
to find the missing value.

Time Complexity:
O(n)

Space Complexity:
O(n)

Drawbacks:
Requires additional memory.
*/

/*
Approach 3: Mathematical Sum (Optimal)

Idea:
Compute the expected sum of numbers from 0 to n using the arithmetic
series formula. Subtract every array element from this sum. The remaining
value is the missing number.

Time Complexity:
O(n)

Space Complexity:
O(1)

Key Insight:
Since exactly one number is missing, the difference between the expected
sum and the actual sum directly gives the answer.
*/

/*
Method to Solve:
----------------
1. Compute the expected sum from 0 to n.
2. Traverse the array.
3. Subtract every element from the expected sum.
4. Return the remaining value.
