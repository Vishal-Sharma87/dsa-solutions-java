/**
 * Utility class to calculate the length of a singly linked list.
 * 
 * Problem Description:
 * Given the head of a singly linked list, find the total number of nodes
 * present in the linked list.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: head = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> null
 * Output: 5
 * 
 * Input: head = null
 * Output: 0
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * - Linked list can be empty (head = null)
 * - Number of nodes can be up to 10^6

     * Calculates the length of a singly linked list.
     * 
     * Approach:
     * /*
     * * ★ Single Pass Traversal (Optimal)
     * * Idea: Traverse the entire linked list from head to tail, incrementing
     * * a counter for each node visited.
     * * Time: O(n) - must visit each node exactly once
     * * Space: O(1) - only two variables regardless of list size
     * * Key Insight: Simple and efficient. This is the only way to find length
     * * without modifying the list structure.

     * @return the total number of nodes in the linked list
