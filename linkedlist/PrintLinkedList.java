/**
 * Utility class to print the contents of a singly linked list.
 * 
 * Problem Description:
 * Given the head of a singly linked list, print all node values in order,
 * with each value followed by a space, then a newline at the end.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: head = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> null
 * Output:
 * Printing Singly LinkedList
 * 1 2 3 4
 * 
 * Input: head = null
 * Output:
 * Printing Singly LinkedList
 * (empty line)
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * - Linked list can be empty (head = null)
 * - Number of nodes can be up to 10^6
 * - Node values can be any integer

     * Prints all values in a singly linked list to console.
     * 
     * Approach:
     * /*
     * * ★ Linear Traversal with Console Output (Optimal)
     * * Idea: Traverse the linked list from head to tail, printing each node's
     * * value followed by a space. Print newline after last node.
     * * Time: O(n) - must visit and print each node exactly once
     * * Space: O(1) - only one temporary pointer regardless of list size
     * * Key Insight: Simple and efficient for debugging/displaying list contents.
     * * Space for output is not counted in space complexity.
     * 
     * 
     * @param head the head node of the linked list to print
     * @return void; prints to standard output
