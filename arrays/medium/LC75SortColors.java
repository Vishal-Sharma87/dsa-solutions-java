Problem Description:
--------------------
Statement:
Given an integer array nums containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s, sort the array
in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent in the order:
0 (Red), 1 (White), and 2 (Blue).

You must solve the problem without using the library's sort function.

Example:
Input:
nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]

Output:
[0,0,1,1,2,2]

Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 300
- nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2
*/

/*
Approach 1: Counting Sort

Idea:
Count the occurrences of 0, 1, and 2, then overwrite the array accordingly.

Time Complexity:
O(n)

Space Complexity:
O(1)

Drawbacks:
Requires two passes over the array.
*/

/*
Approach 2: Dutch National Flag Algorithm (Optimal)

Idea:
Maintain three pointers:
- left: next position for 0
- mid: current element
- right: next position for 2

Process each element once:
- If current is 0, swap with left and move both pointers.
- If current is 1, simply move mid.
- If current is 2, swap with right and decrease right without moving mid.

Time Complexity:
O(n)

Space Complexity:
O(1)

Key Insight:
Each element is processed at most once, giving a one-pass in-place solution.
*/

/*
Method to Solve:
----------------
1. Initialize left, mid, and right pointers.
2. Traverse while mid <= right.
3. Place 0s to the left.
4. Place 2s to the right.
5. Leave 1s in the middle.
