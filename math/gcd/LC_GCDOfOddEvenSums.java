Problem Description:
--------------------
Statement:
Given an integer n, find the GCD of the sum of the first n odd numbers and
the sum of the first n even numbers.

Example:
Input:
n = 3

Output:
6

Explanation:
Odd numbers = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9
Even numbers = 2 + 4 + 6 = 12
GCD(9, 12) = 3

Constraints:
1 <= n <= problem constraints
*/

/*
Approach 1: Generate Both Series

Idea:
Generate the first n odd and even numbers separately, compute their sums,
and then calculate their GCD.

Time Complexity:
O(n)

Space Complexity:
O(1)

Drawbacks:
Iterates through every element even though the sums follow arithmetic progression.
*/

/*
Approach 2: Arithmetic Progression Formula (Optimized)

Idea:
The first n odd and even numbers form arithmetic progressions.
Use the AP sum formula to compute both sums in O(1), then apply the
Euclidean Algorithm to find their GCD.

Time Complexity:
O(log(max(sumOdd, sumEven)))

Space Complexity:
O(1)

Key Insight:
Avoid generating the sequences by directly computing their sums using
the arithmetic progression formula.
*/

/*
Method to Solve:
----------------
1. Compute the sum of the first n odd numbers using the AP formula.
2. Compute the sum of the first n even numbers using the AP formula.
3. Compute the GCD of both sums using the Euclidean Algorithm.
4. Return the GCD.
