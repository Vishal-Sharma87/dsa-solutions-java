/*
 * Problem Description:
 * Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of
 * consecutive 1s if you can flip at most k 0s.
 *
 * Example:
 *   Input:  nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
 *   Output: 6   // flip index 9 and 10 → [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
 *
 *   Input:  nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
 *   Output: 10
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   - 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
 *   - nums[i] is either 0 or 1
 *   - 0 <= k <= nums.length
 */

/*
 * Approaches:
 *
 * 1. Brute Force
 *    Idea    : Try every subarray, count zeros inside, track max length where zeros <= k
 *    Time    : O(N^2)
 *    Space   : O(1)
 *    Drawback: Too slow for N = 10^5
 *
 * 2. Sliding Window — shrinking (while loop)
 *    Idea    : Expand right; when flips > k, shrink from left using a while loop
 *              until the window is valid again
 *    Time    : O(2N) — each element can be visited twice (once by r, once by l)
 *    Space   : O(1)
 *    Drawback: Shrinks the window on violation — wastes time when we only care
 *              about windows larger than the current best
 *
 * 3. ★ Sliding Window — fixed-size slide (if statement)
 *    Idea    : Replace the shrink loop with a single if — when flips > k, slide
 *              the window forward by 1 (move l and r together) instead of collapsing it.
 *              The window never shrinks; it only grows or slides.
 *    Time    : O(N) — r and l each move exactly N times, no inner loop
 *    Space   : O(1)
 *    Key Insight: We only care about windows strictly larger than mxLen. Once a
 *                 window of size W is invalid, we never need a window smaller than W —
 *                 so sliding (not shrinking) is enough to find the next valid window of W+1.

    /*
     * Method to solve:
     * 1. Expand r — if nums[r] == 0, increment flips
     * 2. If flips > k, the window is invalid — slide l forward by 1.
     * If nums[l] was 0, decrement flips before moving
     * 3. At this point window size is either the same or larger than before —
     * update mxLen
     * 4. Advance r
