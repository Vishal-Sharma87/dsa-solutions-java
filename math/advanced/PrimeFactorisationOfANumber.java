Problem Description:
--------------------
Statement:
Given an integer array queries of length n, return the prime factorization
of every number in sorted order.

Example:
Input:
queries = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Output:
[[2], [3], [2,2], [5], [2,3]]

Constraints:
- 1 <= queries.length
- Each query is a positive integer.
*/

/*
Approach 1: Trial Division

Idea:
For every number, try dividing it by every integer starting from 2 up to √n.
Whenever a divisor is found, keep dividing until it is no longer divisible.
If the remaining value is greater than 1, it is itself a prime factor.

Time Complexity:
O(√N) per query

Space Complexity:
O(k)
where k is the number of prime factors.

Key Insight:
Every composite number has at least one factor less than or equal to √N.
After removing all smaller factors, any remaining number must be prime.
*/

/*
Method to Solve:
----------------
1. Iterate through every query.
2. For each number, check divisibility from 2 to √n.
3. Keep dividing while the divisor divides the number.
4. Store every prime factor.
5. If a value greater than 1 remains, store it as the last prime factor.
6. Return the list of prime factorizations.
