         * 75. Sort Colors
         * Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them
         * in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in
         * the order red, white, and blue.
         * 
         * We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and
         * blue, respectively.
         * 
         * You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.
         * 
         * 
         * 
         * Example 1:
         * 
         * Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
         * Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
         * Example 2:
         * 
         * Input: nums = [2,0,1]
         * Output: [0,1,2]
         * 
         * 
         * Constraints:
         * 
         * n == nums.length
         * 1 <= n <= 300
         * nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.
         * 
         * 
         * Follow up: Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant
         * extra space?
